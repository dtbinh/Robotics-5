This folder contains examples and code for development of Matlab interfaces.
While I've built some of them, I learned to do it following the rest of files,
which are part of the great work carried out by Matt Fig and who corresponds.

Thus, I show it available for everyone, but I do not try to get any authority over it. 
I am quite thankful to his work, and I just want people to learn more about
the topic. Below is presented a copy from the original license.txt file.

Hope you find it useful
