# Robotics
Projects which are devoted to path planning in robots, its control and other topics on the subject. 

**Please take note of this**: Most of them are not totally correct, and would need a revision before applying them for any purpose other than understanding of the system and theory behind. 

## Current projects
* Control -> Automation of a water plant by fuzzy logic controllers. Implemented in *Matlab*.
* Cinematics -> You will need to install [Peter Corke's toolbox](http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox) to run them. Contains a full analysis for a general robot and a 2D Cyclic Coordinate Descent algorithm.
* Matlab-GUI -> Case samples of *Matlab*'s GUI without the built-in tool GUIDE.
* MobileRobots -> Simple case of use of a Kalman Filter for Autonavigation of a simple robot.
* UAVNavigation -> Full example of an UAV in *Matlab*. Error in the connections of the Kalman output. Needs revision.
* Path-planning -> Robot path-planning. Now only RRT.

Please do not hesitate to send me an e-mail if you find any bug, mistake or just want to understand anything.
